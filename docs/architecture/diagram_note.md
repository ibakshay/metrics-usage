The architecture image was drawn on https://app.diagrams.net/. The native draw.io
source file is called `central_architecture_usage.xml`, while `central_architecture_usage.svg` is its SVG
export. Same apply for `sidecar_rules_usage.xml`

To change the usages diagram, go to https://app.diagrams.net/ and import the
XML source file. After making changes to the diagram, export the result as SVG.
Update both the source file and the SVG export in this directory.
